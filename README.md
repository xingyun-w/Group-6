The latter half of the 18th century saw a rise in female authors and their impact on novel narrative forms. By "novel narrative forms," we refer to the narrative techniques, especially the narrator's perspective. From 1751 to 1800, there was a shift toward introspective, emotion-driven narratives, such as epistolary and first-person forms, reflecting Romanticism's focus on individual emotion.

This project aims to research the observable trends between the time period, gender of author and the narrative forms of this 18th century french literature.
