## Research Question
The research question we have chosen to answer, using our dataset is as follows: 

*”What were the most prevalent novel narrative forms used within the French novel data set from 1751 to 1800, and what were the possible reasons for this?”*

In addition, we will try to answer the following two sub-questions, which will help us to answer the main question:
- *“Is there any clear pattern or shift in in novel narrative forms be observed over time?”*
- *“How did the distribution of authors by gender change between 1751 and 1800, and how does this relate to novel narrative forms?”*

Relevance of research question
Search for three articles which we can point to in this part→

[What makes this question so appropriate for the field of digital humanities, i.e. how do computational methods work as a tool to answer humanistic questions? → Brief introduction of the main question, why is it relevant, and what does an answer to the question provide insights into?.]

[Separate justification of the metadata we will be analyzing and why it is relevant.]

Data

Nature of Dataset
First, describe the size of the dataset. I.e. how many novellas does the dataset consist of? 

Describe from which era the different novellas originate and what typifies this era. 

Describe how they were selected. Was as wide a dataset created as possible or are there more French novellas that are not included (what are their strengths and weaknesses)?

Secondly, describe where these novella are stored, i.e. which archives. Were these many different archives? 

How were the novellas digitized, how was the OCR trained for this? That is, how many pages were manually transcribed? Is there anything about the degree of error? What are its strengths and weaknesses?

## Group Charter 
1. What are the goals of our group? Deliverables and deadlines;
We aim to have the work done 3 days before the course deadline in order to create a buffer in case of unforeseen circumstances.

What the individual members should like to learn from it - All members agree that learning the balance between time investment and quality of the deliverables is a priority. 

2. What are the strengths of our group and its members?
Nikol: literature research, summarising, academic writing  
Xingyun: Programming, data visualisation,critical study
Robert: Writing & editing, media design, controlling/organising
Joanna: critical text analysis, academic writing

3. What are our pressures? - Additional commitments and side projects (time)

4. What communication strategies will we use to communicate? - Most communication will take place through WhatsApp, with file transfer and sharing through the group’s Google Drive. We aim to respond daily.

5. How many meetings will be organized to work on the project together? - Weekly meetings Wednesdays at 13.30, which are logged individually and then integrated into the charter / updated.
